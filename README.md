Home Prices Prediction is a simple tool to estimate housing prices for buying or renting a house at a particular location.

As of now, the model takes into consideration the following aspects:
1. **Plot Area** - sq. ft.
2. **BHK** - Number of bedrooms
3. **Bath** - Number of bathrooms
4. **City** - Which city you're looking in (currently Mumbai and Banglore are supported)
5. **Location** - Street or locality in the selected city

You can estimate the buying price of the flat as well as renting prices/ month.

*While I do not intend to add any further improvements yet, you're free to build a model of your own.*
